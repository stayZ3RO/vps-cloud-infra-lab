## Objective

Connect `stayz3ro.dev` to the Netcup VPS using Porkbun DNS and validate that the root domain and planned subdomains resolve publicly.

This phase also tightened administrative access by restricting SSH to the Tailscale private network.

---

## Why This Phase Matters

DNS is the public entry point for future services.

Before deploying a reverse proxy, HTTPS certificates, or public Docker applications, the domain needs to resolve to the correct VPS.

This phase creates the foundation for:

- Root website routing
- Public app subdomains
- API subdomains
- Status page routing
- HTTPS certificate issuance
- Reverse proxy configuration

## DNS Design

| Record | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| stayz3ro.dev | A | Root domain pointing to Netcup VPS |
| www.stayz3ro.dev | CNAME | Alias to root domain |
| apps.stayz3ro.dev | A | Future public app entry point |
| status.stayz3ro.dev | A | Future status page |
| api.stayz3ro.dev | A | Future API services |

---

## Administrative Access Design

Before this phase, SSH was available publicly through the VPS firewall baseline.

After this phase, SSH is restricted to Tailscale.

    Admin Workstation
          |
          | Tailscale
          v
    Netcup VPS Tailscale IP
          |
          | SSH
          v
    netcup-prod-01

Public SSH is blocked.

## Security Posture After Phase 2

| Control | Status |
|---|---:|
| Public SSH | Blocked |
| Tailscale SSH | Allowed |
| HTTP | Publicly allowed |
| HTTPS | Publicly allowed |
| Direct app ports | Blocked |
| Portainer public exposure | Avoided |
| Database public exposure | Avoided |

---

## Outcome

At the end of this phase:

- Porkbun DNS records point to the Netcup VPS
- Root domain and subdomains resolve publicly
- Public DNS resolvers validate the records
- SSH is restricted to Tailscale
- The VPS is ready for reverse proxy and HTTPS configuration
