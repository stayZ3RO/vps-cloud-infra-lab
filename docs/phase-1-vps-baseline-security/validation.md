## Purpose

This page documents the validation evidence for Phase 1: VPS Baseline & Security Hardening.

The goal is to show that the VPS was not only configured, but also verified through command output and redacted screenshots.

## Validation Summary

| Area | Validation Result |
|---|---|
| Hostname | Configured and resolving cleanly |
| OS | Ubuntu Linux documented |
| SSH service | Active and running |
| SSH config | Syntax validation passed |
| Firewall | UFW enabled with limited exposure |
| Brute-force protection | Fail2Ban active for SSH |
| Updates | Unattended upgrades enabled |
| Runtime | Docker and Docker Compose installed |
| Private access | Tailscale connected |
| Filesystem | /opt/stayz3ro structure created |
| Ports | Listening services reviewed |

---
