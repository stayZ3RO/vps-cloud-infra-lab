# Phase 3 - Reverse Proxy & HTTPS 🔒

## Purpose

This diagram represents the public HTTPS edge introduced in Phase 3.

A single reverse proxy (Caddy) terminates TLS for `stayz3ro.dev`, serves a
static landing page, and is staged to route future backend services without
exposing their ports.

## Exposure Model After Phase 3

| Traffic | Exposure |
|---|---|
| HTTP (80) | Public - redirects to HTTPS, serves ACME challenge |
| HTTPS (443) | Public - static landing page only |
| `www` subdomain | Public - redirects to apex |
| `apps` / `status` / `api` | Not routed yet (staged in Caddyfile) |
| Backend app ports | Internal Docker network only, never published |
| Caddy admin API | Disabled |
| SSH | Tailscale only |

---

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|---|---|
| Caddy over NPM / Traefik | One config file, automatic TLS, no admin port, no database - smallest attack surface on a public node |
| Static page served in Phase 3 | Gives HTTPS something real to serve before apps exist; externally verifiable |
| `admin off` | The Caddy admin API is not needed and should not be listening |
| JSON access logs from day one | Structured logs ready for a log stack in Phase 5 |
| Backend routes staged but commented | Keeps Phase 4 wiring visible without exposing anything early |
| `caddy_data` named volume | Persists issued certs and ACME account across restarts; avoids Let's Encrypt rate limits |

---

## Next Architecture Layer

**Phase 4 - Docker App Deployment**

That phase will bring up the first backend container on the `web` network and
enable one of the staged `reverse_proxy` routes.
