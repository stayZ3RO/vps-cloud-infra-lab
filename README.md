## Building a Production-Style VPS Cloud Lab

This repository documents my VPS lab: Linux and Docker hosting, public DNS, Caddy HTTPS, uptime monitoring, and private administration. Backup and restore work is still planned.

The goal is to move beyond local-only homelab infrastructure and build practical experience with public cloud-style hosting, Linux server hardening, DNS routing, containerized deployments, and production-minded documentation.

This project is part of my broader infrastructure learning path toward cloud, network, and systems engineering roles.

---

## Why I Built This

After building out my home network infrastructure lab, I wanted to extend the same hands-on approach into public-facing cloud infrastructure.

This VPS lab gives me a place to practice:

- Managing real Linux servers exposed to the public internet
- Hardening SSH and host-level access
- Using firewall rules and brute-force protection
- Hosting containerized services with Docker
- Connecting a custom domain to public infrastructure
- Deploying services behind a reverse proxy with HTTPS
- Building monitoring, backups, and staging workflows
- Documenting infrastructure decisions like an engineer

## Completed Work

### Phase 1 - VPS Baseline & Security Hardening

Phase 1 prepared the Netcup VPS as a secure Linux baseline before deploying public services.

Highlights:

- Configured hostname: `netcup-prod-01`
- Created a non-root sudo user
- Hardened SSH access
- Disabled root SSH login
- Disabled password-based SSH login
- Enabled UFW firewall
- Enabled Fail2Ban
- Enabled unattended security updates
- Installed Docker and Docker Compose
- Installed Tailscale
- Created `/opt/stayz3ro` folder structure
- Reviewed listening ports

### Phase 2 - Domain DNS & Public Routing

Phase 2 connected `stayz3ro.dev` to the VPS and improved the management-plane security model.

Highlights:

- Removed Porkbun parking records
- Added root domain DNS record
- Added `www`, `apps`, `status`, and `api` records
- Validated local DNS resolution
- Validated public DNS resolvers
- Confirmed SSH over Tailscale
- Removed public SSH access
- Confirmed UFW allows SSH only over `tailscale0`
- Captured redacted validation screenshots

### Phase 3 - Reverse Proxy & HTTPS

Phase 3 put Caddy in front of the VPS and served Uptime Kuma at `status.stayz3ro.dev` over HTTPS while backend ports stayed private. The 2026-10-04 domain move below records the current host.

Highlights:

- Deployed the Caddy stack on the VPS (2026-08-30)
- Issued a Let's Encrypt certificate for `status.stayz3ro.dev`, renewed automatically
- Reverse-proxied Uptime Kuma; its admin account was created over a private SSH tunnel before exposure
- HTTP redirects to HTTPS (308)
- Validated security headers and the JSON access log
- Confirmed backend ports are not public with an external probe
- Captured redacted validation screenshots

### Phase 5 - Monitoring & Alerts

Since 2026-09-28, Uptime Kuma has watched six public-edge targets plus
`ntfy-health`. Discord carries alerts for all six primary monitors; the
self-hosted ntfy provider also reaches a phone. A synthetic DOWN/UP test
validated the Discord path. An independent offsite check remains planned
because Kuma and the services share the VPS.

### Domain move (2026-10-04)

The blog now runs at `blog.chrisalorenzo.com` on Cloudflare Pages. The public
status page is `status.chrisalorenzo.com/status/main`, with `Sites` and `Infra`
groups. Its root returns 302 to `/status/main`; public admin paths return 404.
Kuma has tailnet-only admin via `tailscale serve` on port 8443, backed by IPv4
loopback port 3001. Docker is 29.8.1.

Caddy returns 301 from `status.stayz3ro.dev` to `status.chrisalorenzo.com`.
Cloudflare returns 301 from `stayz3ro.dev` and `www.stayz3ro.dev` to
`blog.chrisalorenzo.com`. Both preserve the path and query. The two old blog
hosts were removed from the Pages custom domains and use redirect-only DNS
records.

The renamed monitor displays are `Blog`, `Portfolio`, `HTTPS Edge`,
`DNS (stayz3ro.dev)` and `DNS (chrisalorenzo.com)`. Their old names remain as
`id` tags; [Current Status](CURRENT-STATUS.md#monitoring-and-alerts) records the
mapping and remaining target checks. TLS expiry warnings are set to 14 days.
There are no push monitors.
